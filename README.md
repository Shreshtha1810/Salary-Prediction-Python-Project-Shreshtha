Welcome to the Salary Prediction Project!This project aims to predict the salary of individuals based on their work experience and the country they work in. The project is developed in Python and deployed using Streamlit, making it easy to interact with and use.

Overview:
This project is a simple machine learning application that predicts salaries based on the user's work experience and their country of work. Using a dataset of salaries, the application trains a model to understand how these factors influence salary outcomes. The application is deployed using Streamlit, a popular framework for building interactive web applications in Python.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file (survey_results_public.csv.csv)

Installation:
To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/salary-prediction.git
cd salary-prediction
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure requirements.txt contains the following packages (or run pip freeze > requirements.txt to auto-generate):

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
streamlit
Usage:
To run the Streamlit application, execute the following command:


streamlit run app.py
This will start a local server, and you will be able to access the application via your web browser at http://localhost:8501.

Enter the number of years of experience.
Select the country from the dropdown menu.
Click on the "Predict Salary" button to see the predicted salary.
